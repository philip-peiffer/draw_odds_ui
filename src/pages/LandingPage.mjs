                <p>
                    Welcome to the Montana Draw Odds Calculator! This tool was created to help people research potential 
                    tag applications for the Montana hunting season. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To get started, you must choose your residency and the species you wish to hunt. This is because the MT FWP
                    likes to re-use tag numbers between species. After these selections have been made, smash the "Let's Go!" button, or read on to find out more about the app.
                </p>

                <h4>Detailed Instructions:</h4>
                <p>
                    This section is completely voluntary - if you feel ready to go hit the "Let's Go!" button below.
                    If you've stuck around - welcome. This app is going to walk you through different selections, ultimately leading to you choosing a tag to calculate your draw odds. Montana is split into 7 different regions. These regions are then split into districts. Within each district, you have certain tags that you can apply for. As you've seen, you already chose species and residency. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next page will present you with data about the different <em>regions</em> so that you can choose a region to explore. You will then be presented with data about the different <em>districts</em>. This will then be followed by <em>tags</em>. Once you've settled on a tag, you will then have the option of calculating your draw odds for that tag.
